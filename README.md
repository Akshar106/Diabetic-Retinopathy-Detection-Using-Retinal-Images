## Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy is a progressive disease that affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to leakage, swelling, and eventually, vision loss. Detecting diabetic retinopathy at an early stage is essential for timely intervention and treatment.
